### `GOAL`

1. FIRST -> I plan on developing the tic tac toe game following the tutorial. Learning basic react components / design. 
2. SECOND -> I plan on adding a log in function and using a SQL database to store user id
3. THIRD -> Create a leaderboard function to keep track of wins.
4. I know leaderboard will not show accurate results since the player is playing against himself, but I will learn more about SQL.
