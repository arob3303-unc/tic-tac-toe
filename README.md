# Tic Tac Toe tutorial build -> to learn React.js
#### I got bored one night :D

## Link to the tutorial
[https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial]


IMPORTANT -> My SQL server is being run locally, so the log in will not work for other users. I will SOON put it on AWS. So for now, I am disabling log in feature so people can play tictactoe!


### `GOAL`

1. FIRST -> I plan on developing the tic tac toe game following the tutorial. Learning basic react components / design. 
2. SECOND -> I plan on adding a log in function and using a SQL database to store user id
3. THIRD -> Create a leaderboard function to keep track of wins.
4. I know leaderboard will not show accurate results since the player is playing against himself, but I will learn more about SQL.
